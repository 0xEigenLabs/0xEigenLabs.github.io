# Stealth Address
Stealth addresses provide the receiver with great anonymity. If you want to receive an anonymous payment transaction, you just need to provide the public key of your address to the sender.

You can select **Copy Public Key** from the address of **My Account**, and tell the sender of the public key.

If you want to send an anonymous payment transaction, you need to click the button **Hide** on the **Send** page, indicating that an anonymous payment will be initiated, then enter the recipient's public key, and click **Send**. The difference from ordinary transfers is that it is no longer receiving the address of the recipient, but the public key of the recipient.
