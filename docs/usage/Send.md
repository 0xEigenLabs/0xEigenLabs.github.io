## Send
Send assets to corresponding addresses by selecting different networks. Among them, the recipient address asset can choose the Multisig Wallet address.

You can choose the Multisig Wallet address to send assets, also.

If you choose the Multisig Wallet address to send assets, and the amount of the assets you are going to send is larger than the payment limit (see [here](https://ieigen.github.io/#/docs/usage/MultisigWallet?id=my-wallet)), it will need the N/2 signers to jointly sign for you to complete the transaction. For example, we can set the max per transation as 0.1 ETH:

Suppose you send 0.2 ETH to an address, which is greater than 0.1 ETH

You should receive this information, which means the transacation should be confirmed by signer(s)

Then you can see in the overview, the transcation should be confirmed by signers (more than N/2 signers)

If it can be executed, then you can click "Executed" to send the assets finally
