## Quick start

This is private testnet, and only Test Token is registered in our network. So we only distribute the TestToken via our [TG](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@Eigen_Network).

Join our TG and receive the Test Token before shielding your transaction.

Starting your first private transaction via Eigen Secret is easy. Just `sign-up` by your Metamask, `deposit` the TestToken or test MATIC to Eigen Secret L2, send to L2, or wthdraw the token back to L1 as your will.
