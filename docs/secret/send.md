# Private Send

**NOTE**: The test network has only been deployed on [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/), so make sure you have some test MATIC before registration.

All the contracts of Eigen Secret can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xEigenLabs/eigen-secret/zkpay_dev/.contract.json).

## Quick start

This is private testnet, and only Test Token is registered in our network. So we only distribute the TestToken via our [TG](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@Eigen_Network).

Join our TG and receive the Test Token before shielding your transaction.

Starting your first private transaction via Eigen Secret is easy.

1. Open [https://secret.eigen.cash](https://secret.eigen.cash/), and just `sign-up` by your Metamask;

2. `deposit` the TestToken(Address: 0x0Cec6Fe05474F57E5158328E36abf2aA3BF00e70) or test MATIC to Eigen Secret L2;

3. send to L2, or wthdraw the token back to L1 as your will.
