## Eigen Secret
Eigen Secret is a private L2 based on Aggregation Zero Knowledge Proof and Threshold Public Key Encryption, aiming to offer a privacy-preserving and regulatory-friendly payment channel to businesses, DAO, or individual users on payroll and C2B payment.

Each user owns an account key generated by the user's self-custodial wallets, like Metamask, a sealing key generated by DKG to seal the transaction.

The asset model is built on extended UTXO, and both FT and NFT are supported.

All circuits are implemented by Circom 2 and proved by eigen-zkit.

The core features are:

* Low gas cost: uses aggregation ZKP to compress the batch proof and zkRollup to compress the transaction execution.

* Security: assets are controlled by the user's account key generated by Metamask or other self-custodial wallets.

* Privacy preservation: Anonymity and transaction data encryption are enabled to preserve user asserts' privacy.

* Regulation friendly: the sealed transaction can be recovered by secure multiple computations among regulator and user.

* Easy-to-integrate: the node and web SDK are provided for businesses and end-user to access.
