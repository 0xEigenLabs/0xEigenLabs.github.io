# Eigen Labs

Our mission is to allow the aggregated proof to be verified anywhere.

## Highlights
* Developer friendly
Built on RISCV microarchitecture and making it possible for most of the RISCV program to be proved
Enable the developer to write Rusty circuits

* Modular proof system:
The first Rust eSTARK implementation, and support eSTARK-to-Groth16/Plonk
Support BN12381 and BN254 for on-chain verification

* Continuation and proof composition
Allow the program to be split into multiple chunks, and all the chunks are proved parallelly.

* Universal proof aggregation
Aggregates proofs for different circuits to reduce the average gas cost for end users.


## Architecture

We focues on build the Proof market and Aggregation layer for zkVM ecosystem.
