# Eigen zkVM Developer Documentation Site
Eigen Network builds the general-purpose zkVM with native privacy-preserving technology support on its modular proof system.

## Dependencies
To work on this site you will need:
- Linux or macOS (Windows may work, but is unsupported).
- Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer
- Bundler â€” If Ruby is already installed, but the bundle command doesn't work,
just run `gem install bundler:1.16.3` in a terminal.
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

## Build

Build site and slate API docs from the project's root directory:
```bash
./bin/build
```

## Run

To view the site locally, execute the build command first, and then run a simple
http server from the project's `/build` directory:

```bash
$ cd build
```

Python2:

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Python3:

```bash
$ python -m http.server 8080
```

Ruby:
```bash
$ ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8080
```

Node.js:
```bash
$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server -p 8080
```

The site will run at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Updating API Docs
The [API Documentation](https://0xeigenlabs.github.io/api-docs/index.html)
runs on the Open Source [Slate Framework](https://github.com/lord/slate).
To make an update, fork the repo and make the changes to the appropriate
markdown in this [file directory](https://github.com/0xEigenLabs/0xEigenLabs.github.io/tree/master/src/api-docs/source/includes/).
To use livereload while working on the API docs, use middleman livereload like so:
``` bash
$ cd ./0xeigenlabs.github.io/src/api-docs/
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec middleman server
```

When your PR is merged the new docs will be deployed to the live docs page.
